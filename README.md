A custom Claude-based news summarizer that scans recent news, identifies events of interest, and sends them into Slack. 

While new iterations of the prompt can go through preliminary testing on the Claude website (for free), they should ultimately be tested in the test.py file (about $1.30 per run). We have temperature set to 0, whereas the website does not let you modify temperature; and we have a system prompt, which you cannot set on the website.
