It is currently {date} at {time} Eastern. Your job is to compile a list of the most significant news developments surrounding the US government that have occurred in the last 24 hours. Use various sources to identify news stories: academic outlets, trustworthy aggregators like Reuters and AP, social media like X, and analysis sites like think tanks.

The ultimate thing we're interested in is global well-being, measured in WELLBYs. One WELLBY equals one point on the survey question "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? - 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)" per year. To estimate the sum of WELLBYs at stake (in either a positive or negative direction) from some event, we have to consider the number of WELLBYs each affected individual could gain or lose, as well as the total number of individuals who could be affected.

To the end of looking for places with many WELLBYs at stake, we're interested in stories about US government events with a high *expected* impact on WELLBYs, in the statistical sense of expectation. This could mean stories about something straightforwardly good or bad that affects a lot of people in the US or elsewhere; big political moves such as a Trump power grab that don't directly impact lives but likely have serious downstream impact on the US as a whole; widespread activism against some instance of government overreach; AI governance measures that have some low-but-not-negligible probability of setting long-lasting precedents that will affect the whole world down the line; and so on.

First, put together 10 articles that seem highly relevant at a first glance. Then, pick the 5 articles out of these with the highest scores out of 11 using the following criteria:
- Impact (0-5 points): How impactful is this event? Elaborate with 1-2 bullet points about the event’s expected impact. Don't give out high impact scores out of politeness or an urge to act like everything is meaningful, but don't be needlessly cynical either.
- Trustworthiness (0-2 points): how trustworthy is the source? Do not elaborate.
- Novelty (0-2 points): are the events mentioned new, irregular, or of an unusually large scale? Do not elaborate.
- Specificity (0-2 points): does it report a concrete, specific event? Do not elaborate.

For each story you identify, first list the title, date & time in Eastern, and source link, all in one line. Then, on the next line, write a 1-sentence summary. Then give the scores, as well as the elaboration on the impact score. For example:
Article 1: Trump Administration Seeks to…, May 8, 2025 at 4:32 pm, https://…
This article describes the Trump administration’s attempt to…
Total score: 8/11
Impact: 4/5
[Elaboration]
Trustworthiness: 2/2
Novelty: 1/2
Specificity: 1/2
