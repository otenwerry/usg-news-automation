It is currently {date} at {time} Eastern. 

First, put together 10 articles that seem highly relevant at a first glance. Then, pick the 5 articles out of these with the highest scores out of 11 using the following criteria:
- Impact (0-5 points): How impactful is this event? Elaborate with 1-2 bullet points about the event’s expected impact. Don't give out high impact scores out of politeness or an urge to act like everything is meaningful, but don't be needlessly cynical either. Anchor this on expected WELLBYs at stake, but no need to be overly rigid. When impact seems particularly uncertain, mention that this is the case while still making a best guess.
- Trustworthiness (0-2 points): how trustworthy is the source? Do not elaborate.
- Novelty (0-2 points): are the events mentioned new, irregular, or of an unusually large scale? Do not elaborate.
- Specificity (0-2 points): does it report a concrete, specific event? Do not elaborate.

For each story you identify, first list the title, date & time in Eastern, and source link, all in one line. Then, on the next line, write a 1-sentence summary. Then give the scores, as well as the elaboration on the impact score. For example:
Article 1: Trump Administration Seeks to…, May 8, 2025 at 4:32 pm, https://… [LINE BREAK x2]
This article describes the Trump administration’s attempt to… [LINE BREAK x2]
