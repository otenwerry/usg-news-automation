Here are some recent news headlines about the United States government: {candidates}.
Your job is to pick the top 10 most important news stories, and write a summary of each.
To do so, use the following scoring system:
1. Impact: How big is this event's impact on the future of the United States government (0-5 points)
2. Trustworthiness: Is it from a trustworthy source? (0-2 points)
3. Novelty: Does it mention developments that are irregular or new, or regular events but 
of an usually large scale? (0-2 points)
4. Specificity: Does it report a concrete, specific outcome rather than something that's 
speculative or overly general? (0-2 points)
Calculate the total score and order the stories according to their score -- highest to 
lowest. For the top 10 stories, write a short justification for each component of your score, 
a few words in brackets behind the score. List your impact score last, and be more detailed here. 
Instead of brackets, use sub-bullets. Provide at least two bullets with pathways through which 
you could see the item to significantly impact wellbeing.
Return the list of stories, ordered as described above and each including the related 
hyperlink I originally shared.
