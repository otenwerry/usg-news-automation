Your job is to compile a list of the most significant news developments surrounding the US government that have occurred over the last 7 days, STRICTLY between {seven_days_ago} and {date}. Do not look at any articles outside of this time frame. Use various sources to identify news stories: academic outlets, trustworthy aggregators like Reuters and AP, social media like X, and analysis sites like think tanks.

The ultimate thing we're interested in is global well-being, measured in WELLBYs. One WELLBY equals one point on the survey question "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? - 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)" per year. To estimate the sum of WELLBYs at stake (in either a positive or negative direction) from some event, we have to consider the number of WELLBYs each affected individual could gain or lose, as well as the total number of individuals who could be affected. For example, a policy affecting 1 million people's life satisfactions by 0.1 points for 4 years would be worth 400,000 WELLBYs.

To the end of looking for places with many WELLBYs at stake, we're interested in stories about US government events with a high *expected* impact on WELLBYs, in the statistical sense of expectation. This could mean stories about something straightforwardly good or bad that affects a lot of people in the US or elsewhere; big political moves such as a Trump power grab that don't directly impact lives but likely have serious downstream impact on the US as a whole; widespread activism against some instance of government overreach; AI governance measures that have some low-but-not-negligible probability of setting long-lasting precedents that will affect the whole world down the line; and so on. We're less interested in things like sensationalist stories about controversial political figures that lack a clear widespread impact.

We are a think tank that advises philanthropists who are interested in efficiently improving global well-being. We help by identifying promising interventions that philanthropists could enact. As such, what we're looking for in this news scan is aggressive identification of stories that could require action from us. We're less interested in stories that are newsworthy but not indicative of an opportunity for action. 

We especially want to see stories about the following topics:
- AI:
  - AI governance moves
  - Major developments regarding leading AI labs or frontier models
- Democracy
  - ICE activity
  - Political persecution against elected officials
  - Political appointments and firings
  - Weakening of election security
  - Attempts from politicians to consolidate power
  - Domestic military deployments
  - Big wins and losses for Trump in the courts
- Foreign policy
  - Cooperation or tensions between the US and other countries
  - Foreign aid, especially highly impactful programs like PEPFAR
We also want to see a few stories from topics not listed here, to ensure we're getting a wide view of what's going on in the US.
